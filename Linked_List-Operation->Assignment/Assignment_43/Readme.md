# Assignment_43

Here contains multiple **C programs** that perform various operations on a **Singly Linear Linked List**.  
Each program demonstrates important linked list concepts such as traversal, mathematical computations, and data manipulation.  
These programs are designed for learning and practicing **Data Structures and Algorithms** in C.
